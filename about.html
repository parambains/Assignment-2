				<p>The song draws parallerls between the life and death of 2pac and moosewala.<br>
					 2pac was a revolutionary rapper who rose from zero to hero and his songs mostly focused on real life problems faced by blacks.<br> 
					The song basically draws the parellel that moosewala, because of his similarities in speaking truth and bold statements like 2pac, will die in his prime like him</p>
